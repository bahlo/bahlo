I'm Arne Bahlo, a software engineer from Germany. I love open-source software, mostly writing [Go](https://github.com/bahlo?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=go) and [Rust](https://github.com/bahlo?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=rust) myself. 
I also co-host two (German) podcasts: [Sprachnachrichten](https://sprachnachrichten.fm) and [Musikradar](https://musikradar.org).

I'd love to hear from you! :email: <hallo@arne.me> or üêò [ab@chaos.social](https://chaos.social/@ab).
